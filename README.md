## About This Project

This repository provides a series of tutorials designed to bridge the gap between computer vision theory and practical application in aerial robotics. Whether you're a student, a hobbyist, or a researcher, these guides will walk you through the fundamental building blocks of spatial perception for drones and other autonomous systems. We cover foundational skills like object detection before progressing to building a complete, Vision-based navigation pipeline from scratch.

## What You'll Learn

-   **Object Detection:** Learn to use pre-trained deep learning models like **YOLO** to locate and classify objects in real-time.
-   **Object Tracking:** Implement classic and modern object trackers (**CSRT, KCF**) to follow a specific object across multiple video frames.
-   **Feature Detection & Matching:** Understand and implement algorithms like **ORB** to find and match keypoints between images.
-   **Motion Estimation:** Learn how to calculate the camera's rotation and translation using the **Essential Matrix** and **RANSAC**.
-   **Visual Odometry (VO):** Build a complete, step-by-step VO pipeline to track the camera's trajectory through a sequence of images.
-   **Data Visualization:** Create dynamic, real-time visualizations of your algorithm's output using **Matplotlib** and **OpenCV**, complete with on-screen annotations.
-   **SLAM Fundamentals:** Gain a clear understanding of the difference between Visual Odometry and a full **SLAM** system.
